# =================================================================
# .gitattributes for GitHub Linguist
#
# Purpose: Correctly classify languages and ignore irrelevant files
#          for the repository's language statistics bar.
# =================================================================

# --- Language & Extension Overrides ---

# Explicitly treat all .mjs files as JavaScript.
*.mjs linguist-language=JavaScript

# Ensure .sql files are always recognized as SQL.
*.sql linguist-language=SQL

# --- Ignore Dependencies & Generated Files ---

# This is the most important rule. It tells Linguist to completely
# ignore the node_modules directory when calculating language stats.
# NOTE: You should also have node_modules/ in your .gitignore file.
node_modules/* linguist-vendored

# Exclude lockfiles from language statistics.
package-lock.json linguist-vendored
